TODO

Add the necessary slots and signals for question change notification (servicewidget, questionitemwidget, questioneditwindow, optioneditwidget)

----------------------------

TODO

The question edit window doesn't set _answer_signature to anything meaningful
There has to be a way to notify the window about an answer signature being set.
Make it a button. Has a lot less work implied than connecting everythings on changed
signal to some slot.
